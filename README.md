# Conky Config

## Getting Started

This instruction is created on PopOS 22.04. It may work for a similar Ubuntu setup.

Run the following installations,
- `sudo apt lm-sensors`
- `sudo apt install neofetch`,
- `sudo apt install mesa-utils`.

After that, symlink the `.conkyrc` file to your root directory.

```
ln -s /path/to/this/repo/.conkyrc ~/.conkyrc
```
